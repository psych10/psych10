### write our own function to perform a t-test

```{r}

```

### Test it to make sure it gives us the same result as t.test()

```{r}

```

### Create a function that generates two groups of data with a given effect size and sample size

```{r}

```

### create a function that:
### uses the previous function to generate a dataset
### performs a t-test on that dataset to compare groups
### returns the p value for the test

```{r}

```

### run this function 5000 times and compute the proportion of significant results

```{r}

```

### run this function 5000 times while varying the level of signal from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1

```{r}

```

### Plot the proportion of signficant results as a function of effect size

```{r}

```
