I this session we will explore Monte Carlo simulation and resampling.  We will start with the class thinking of ideas for a process to simulate, and then Dr. Poldrack will code the simulation in real time.

First let's load the necessary libraries.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(NHANES)
```
